* Use genome length as criterion
* Search for repeating sequences and lift them up one layer.
* Add a pruning step, which removes unneccessary operations.
* Use PushPop1-4 (push state, execute 1-4 instructions, pop state)
* Use Bracketing.
* Distributed Workpool
* Externalize genome representation
    - Needed for distribution
    - Multi-stage optimization (feed result into another optimization stage)
