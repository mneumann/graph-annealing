* Use single random number generator (easier to provide single seed value)
* Read target graph from file
* Specify evolution parameters in configuration file
    - Population size
    - Offspring population
    - Mutation probability
* Distributed Workpool
* Externalize genome representation
    - Needed for distribution
    - Multi-stage optimization (feed result into another optimization stage)
